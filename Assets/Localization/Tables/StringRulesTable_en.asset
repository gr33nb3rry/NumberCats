      2.
      The player chooses the cell in which he wants to place the number.


      3.
      If all the numbers in the cells go in order from lower to higher, the player
      gets points and coins. Points are calculated by the formula: score = score
      + round number. The number of coins is increased by the number of points earned
      in the current round:

      coins = coins + score.


      4. If a player
      chooses the wrong cell and breaks the order of the numbers, the game ends.'

      record: if the current total score is greater than the record, then the record
      = total score.


      3. if the game is lost, the game checks whether the
      total score + score in the game is greater than the record or not. If greater,
      then record = total score + game score. And resets the total score to zero.'
